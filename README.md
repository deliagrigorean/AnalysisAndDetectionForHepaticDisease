This project develops an advanced medical image processing system dedicated to the analysis of liver ultrasounds, aiming to automatically classify them into six distinct categories. The classification is achieved by combining the anatomical acquisition plane (sagittal, 
coronal, or transverse) with the pathological appearance of the tissue (benign or malignant). Fully implemented in MATLAB, the software serves as a decision-support tool for medical professionals, facilitating a faster and more accurate diagnosis. By enabling the early 
identification of malignant lesions and the rigorous organization of scanning planes, the system directly contributes to preventing disease progression and ensuring more efficient treatment management, providing a modern technological solution to enhance patient care.
